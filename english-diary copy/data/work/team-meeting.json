      "오늘 오전에 팀 미팅 있었는데, 진짜 길었어.",
      "원래 30분 예정이었는데, 1시간 넘게 걸렸거든.",
      "회의실 들어가자마자 분위기가 좀 무거운 게 느껴졌어.",
      "팀장이 프로젝트 진행 상황 물어보는데, 다들 할 말이 없어.",
      "내 차례 됐을 때 진짜 떨렸는데, 준비한 대로 말했어.",
      "근데 중간에 질문 받으니까 당황해서 대답을 제대로 못 했어.",
      "다른 팀원이 도와줘서 겨우 넘어갔는데, 진짜 고마웠어.",
      "회의 중간에 커피 마시러 가고 싶었는데, 참았어.",
      "누가 자기 의견 말하는데 너무 길어서 지루했어, 솔직히.",
      "결론은 결국 다 같이 더 열심히 하자는 건데, 항상 그래.",
      "회의 끝나고 나니까 점심시간인데, 배고파 죽을 뻔했어.",
      "동료들이랑 밥 먹으면서 회의 얘기하는데, 다들 힘들어했어.",
      "다음 주에 또 미팅 있다는데, 벌써 걱정돼.",
      "회의를 줄이면 안 되나 싶은데, 절대 안 줄어들 것 같아."

      "We had a team meeting this morning, and it was literally so long.",
      "It was supposed to be 30 minutes, but it took over an hour.",
      "As soon as I entered the meeting room, I could feel the atmosphere was kind of heavy.",
      "The team leader asked about project progress, and nobody had much to say.",
      "When it was my turn I was really nervous, but I said what I prepared.",
      "But when I got questions in the middle I panicked and couldn't answer properly.",
      "Another team member helped me out so I barely got through, I was really grateful.",
      "During the meeting I wanted to go get coffee, but I held back.",
      "Someone was giving their opinion and it was so long it was boring, honestly.",
      "The conclusion was basically everyone needs to work harder together, like always.",
      "After the meeting ended it was lunchtime, and I was starving.",
      "Eating with coworkers and talking about the meeting, everyone found it tough.",
      "They said we have another meeting next week, and I'm already worried.",
      "I wish we could reduce meetings, but I don't think they'll ever decrease."
