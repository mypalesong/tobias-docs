      "지난 주말에 오랜만에 친구들이랑 만났어, 진짜 오랜만이었어.",
      "다들 바빠서 만나기가 쉽지 않은데, 이번엔 날짜가 딱 맞았어.",
      "강남 쪽 카페에서 만나기로 했는데, 사람들이 엄청 많더라고.",
      "친구 한 명이 30분 늦게 와서 먼저 와 있던 우리끼리 수다 떨었어.",
      "다들 근황 얘기하면서 커피 마시는데, 시간 가는 줄 몰랐어.",
      "한 친구는 최근에 이직했다고 하더라고, 회사 생활 얘기 듣는 게 재미있었어.",
      "다른 친구는 연애 얘기 하느라 정신없었는데, 듣는 재미가 쏠쏠했어.",
      "저녁 먹으러 근처 맛집으로 이동했는데, 거기도 대기가 있었어.",
      "1시간 기다렸는데, 그동안 길거리에서 또 떠들었어.",
      "밥 먹으면서도 계속 얘기하다 보니 3시간이 훌쩍 지나갔어.",
      "헤어질 때 아쉬워서 다음엔 언제 보냐고 물어봤는데, 다들 애매하더라.",
      "집에 오는 길에 오늘 진짜 재밌었다는 생각이 들었어, 또 만나야지."

      "Everyone's busy so it's not easy to meet,, you know, but this time the schedule worked out perfectly.",
      "We agreed to meet at a café, I mean, in Gangnam, and it was super crowded.",
      "One friend , like, was 30 minutes late, so, well, those of us who arrived first just chatted.",
      "Everyone talked about what's been going on while, well, drinking coffee, and I lost track of time.",
      "One friend said they recently changed jobs, and, you know, it was interesting hearing about their company life.",
      "Another friend was busy talking about their, I mean, relationship, and it was fun to listen.",
      "We moved to a nearby restaurant for dinner, and there was a wait there too.",
      "We waited an hour, and during that time we kept chatting on the street.",
      "Even while eating, we kept, like, talking and 3 hours flew by.",
      "When we were saying goodbye, I felt sad and asked when we'd meet again, but everyone was vague.",
      "On my way home, I thought today, you know, was really fun, we should meet again."
