      "카페는 분위기도 좋고 커피 맛도 괜찮아서 자주 가.",
      "서점은 독립 서점인데, 책들이 독특하고 재밌어.",
      "2층은 전시 공간이랑 작은 공연장으로 꾸며져 있어.",
      "주말마다 다양한 전시나 공연이 열려서 구경하러 가곤 해.",
      "동네 주민들한테 문화 공간이 생긴 거라 다들 좋아해.",
      "젊은 사람들도 많이 오게 되면서 동네 분위기가 활기차졌어.",

      "Last year, there was a big change in my neighborhood.",
      "There was an old empty building, and it, like, was newly made into a complex cultural space.",
      "The construction period was a bit long and noisy, but the result was really good.",
      "On the first floor, a café and a small bookstore opened.",
      "The café has a good atmosphere and the coffee tastes good, so I go often.",
      "The bookstore is an independent bookstore, and the books are unique and interesting.",
      "The second floor is decorated with an exhibition space and a small performance hall.",
      "Various exhibitions and performances are held every weekend, so I often go to see them.",
      "Since a cultural space was created for neighborhood residents, everyone likes it.",
      "As many young people also started coming, the neighborhood atmosphere became lively.",
      "It used to be just quiet, but these days it has a more, you know, diverse feeling.",
      "I hope more changes like this happen."
