      "아, 지난달에 스마트폰 배터리가 갑자기 고장 났던 적이 있어요.",
      "어느 날 갑자기 배터리가 30%에서 바로 꺼지는 거예요.",
      "아침에 충전 100%로 나왔는데, 점심때쯤 되면 벌써 꺼지고 그랬어요.",
      "처음에는 앱 문제인 줄 알고 다 지워봤는데도 소용없더라고요.",
      "그래서 서비스센터에 전화했는데, 배터리 교체가 필요하다고 하더라고요.",
      "근데 문제는 예약이 2주 후에나 가능하다는 거예요.",
      "그동안 보조배터리를 계속 들고 다녀야 했어요.",
      "정말 불편했죠. 중요한 순간에 꺼질까봐 항상 신경 쓰였어요.",
      "결국 서비스센터 가서 배터리 교체했는데, 비용이 8만원이나 나왔어요.",
      "생각보다 비싸서 좀 아깝더라고요.",
      "근데 교체하고 나니까 훨씬 좋아졌어요.",
      "이후로는 휴대폰을 좀 더 조심히 쓰게 된 것 같아요."

      "Oh, last month my smartphone battery suddenly broke down.",
      "One day, the battery suddenly turned off at 30%.",
      "In the morning it showed 100% charge, but by lunchtime it would already turn off.",
      "At first I thought it was an app problem so I deleted everything, but it was useless.",
      "So I called the service center, and they said battery replacement was needed.",
      "But the problem was that reservation was only possible 2 weeks later.",
      "In the meantime, I had to keep carrying around a portable battery.",
      "It was really inconvenient. I was always worried it would turn off at an important moment.",
      "Eventually I went to the service center and replaced the battery, and the cost was 80,000 won.",
      "It was more expensive than I thought, so it felt a bit wasteful.",
      "But after replacing it, it got much better.",
      "Since then, I think I've been using my phone more carefully."
