      "작년에 부산 여행 갔을 때 숙소에 문제가 있었어.",
      "온라인으로 예약했던 숙소에 도착했는데, 생각했던 것과 완전 달랐어.",
      "사진이랑 실제 모습이 너무 다르고, 청결 상태도 안 좋았어.",
      "게다가 에어컨도 고장 나 있어서 정말 당황했어.",
      "일단 숙소 주인한테 연락해서 상황을 설명했어.",
      "근데 별로 해결해 줄 생각이 없는 것 같더라고.",
      "결국 다른 숙소를 급하게 찾아봤어.",
      "친구가 검색해서 근처에 괜찮은 호텔을 찾았어.",
      "가격이 좀 비쌌지만, 안전하고 깨끗해서 그리로 옮겼어.",
      "원래 숙소는 환불 요청했는데, 일부만 받을 수 있었어.",
      "아쉽긴 했지만, 다행히 나머지 여행은 잘 마쳤어.",
      "그 이후로는 숙소 예약할 때 리뷰를 꼼꼼히 확인하게 됐어."

      "Last year when I traveled to Busan, there was a problem with the accommodation.",
      "I arrived at the accommodation I booked online, and it was, like, completely different from what I expected.",
      "The photos and actual appearance were too different, and the cleanliness was also bad.",
      "Moreover, the air conditioner was broken, so I was really flustered.",
      "First, I contacted the accommodation owner and explained the situation.",
      "But it seemed they didn't really want to resolve it.",
      "Eventually, I urgently looked for other accommodation.",
      "My friend searched and found a decent hotel nearby.",
      "The price was a bit expensive, but it was safe and clean, so we, you know, moved there.",
      "I requested a refund for the original accommodation, but could only get a partial refund.",
      "It was regretful, but fortunately the rest of the trip went well.",
      "Since then, when booking accommodation, I've been checking reviews thoroughly."
