      "어제 택시 타고 가다가 교통 체증에 걸렸어, 정말 짜증났어.",
      "약속 시간에 늦을 것 같아서 택시를 탔는데, 오히려 더 늦었어.",
      "차가 전혀 안 움직이더라고, 완전 꽉 막혀서.",
      "기사님이 우회로로 가보자고 했는데, 그것도 막혀 있었어.",
      "택시 미터기만 계속 올라가는 걸 보니까 속상하더라.",
      "핸드폰으로 약속한 친구한테 늦는다고 연락했어.",
      "창밖 보면서 그냥 걸어갈까 하는 생각도 들었어.",
      "30분 넘게 갇혀 있으니까 진짜 답답하더라고.",
      "사고가 났나 했는데, 그냥 차가 많은 거였어.",
      "결국 약속 장소에 20분 늦게 도착했어.",
      "다음부턴 중요한 약속 있을 땐 일찍 나가야겠어.",
      "지하철이 시간은 정확하긴 한데, 불편한 건 어쩔 수 없지."

      "Well, yesterday I took a taxi and got stuck in traffic, and it was, like, so frustrating.",
      "I took a taxi because I thought I'd be late for my appointment, but, you know, I was even later.",
      "The car wasn't moving at all, like, completely jammed.",
      "The driver suggested taking a detour, but, um, that was jammed too.",
      "Watching the taxi meter keep going up made me, like, really upset.",
      "I texted the friend I was meeting to say I'd be late, you know.",
      "Looking out the window, I even thought about, like, just walking.",
      "Being stuck for over 30 minutes was, I mean, really suffocating.",
      "I thought there was an accident, but it was, like, just heavy traffic.",
      "In the end, I arrived 20 minutes late to meet my friend.",
      "Next time, I'll have to, you know, leave earlier when I have important appointments.",
      "The subway is reliable with time, but, well, the inconvenience is unavoidable."
