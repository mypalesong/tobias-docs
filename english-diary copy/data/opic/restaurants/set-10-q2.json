      "지난달에 새로 생긴 일식집 갔다가 최악의 경험했어.",
      "인스타 보고 예쁜 것 같아서 친구랑 예약하고 갔거든.",
      "일단 들어가자마자 직원이 우리를 10분이나 방치했어.",
      "자리 안내도 없고, 물도 안 갖다줘서 먼저 요청했어.",
      "메뉴 주문하는데 웨이터가 짜증 난 표정으로 응대하더라고.",
      "음식은 30분 넘게 기다렸는데, 나온 거 보고 실망했어.",
      "사진이랑 완전 다르고, 양도 적어서 가격 대비 별로였어.",
      "게다가 밥이 덜 익어서 딱딱하고 맛도 없었어.",
      "친구가 먹던 초밥에서 이상한 냄새가 나서 바꿔달라고 했어.",
      "그런데 직원이 원래 이런 맛이라면서 교체 거부했어.",
      "결국 매니저 불러서 컴플레인했더니 그제서야 사과하더라.",
      "다신 안 갈 거야, 리뷰에도 별 하나 줬어."

      "Last month, I went to a newly opened Japanese restaurant and had the worst experience.",
      "I saw it on Instagram and it looked pretty, so I made a reservation with a friend and went.",
      "First of all, as soon as we entered, the staff, like, left us unattended for 10 minutes.",
      "There was no seat guidance, and they didn't bring water, so I requested it first.",
      "When ordering from the menu, the waiter responded with an annoyed expression.",
      "We waited over 30 minutes for the food, and when it came out, I was disappointed.",
      "It was completely different from the photo, and the portion was small, so, you know, it wasn't worth the price.",
      "Moreover, the rice was undercooked, hard, and didn't taste good.",
      "My friend's sushi had a strange smell, so we asked them to change it.",
      "But the staff said this is the original taste and, well, refused to replace it.",
      "Eventually, I called the manager and complained, and only then did they apologize.",
      "I'll never go again, I mean, I gave it one star in the review."
