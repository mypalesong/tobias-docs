      "야근도 많이 했는데, 팀원들이 다 같이 고생해서 견딜 만했어.",

      "Last month, I, like, was assigned a new system development project.",
      "At first, the requirements weren't clear, so I felt lost.",
      "I had several meetings with the client and figured out exactly what they wanted.",
      "The schedule was tight, so I shared progress with team members, you know, every day.",
      "In the middle, a technical problem occurred, and I racked my brains for several days.",
      "Eventually, I asked another team for advice and found a solution.",
      "I worked overtime a lot, but, well, it was bearable because all the team members struggled together.",
      "A week before the deadline, it was almost complete, but suddenly a modification request came in.",
      "I was stressed, but I set priorities and, like, handled them one by one.",
      "Eventually, I completed the project on time.",
      "The client was satisfied, and I mean, I got praised by my team leader.",
      "It was hard, but I learned a lot, so I feel like I've grown."
