      "앉아달라고 부탁했는데, 다들 서 있다면서 안 앉더라고.",
      "결국 나도 계속 서 있어야 했는데, 키가 작아서 잘 안 보였어.",
      "그리고 옆사람이 계속 핸드폰으로 동영상 촬영을 해서 거슬렸어.",
      "공연장에서는 촬영 금지인데도 막 찍더라고.",
      "스태프한테 얘기하려다가 말았어.",
      "또 공연 끝나고 나올 때 사람이 너무 많아서 혼잡했어.",
      "한 시간 넘게 기다렸는데도 빠져나가기 힘들었어.",
      "대중교통도 너무 붐벼서 집에 가는 데 오래 걸렸어.",
      "그래도 공연 자체는 좋았어서 만족했어.",
      "다음엔 좀 더 좋은 자리로 예매해야겠다고 생각했어."

      "Last year when I went to a concert, there was a somewhat awkward situation.",
      "My seat was in the back, and the person in front kept standing, so I couldn't see.",
      "I asked them to sit down, but they didn't sit, saying everyone was standing.",
      "Eventually I had to keep standing too, but I'm short so I couldn't see well.",
      "And the person next to me kept filming videos on their phone, which was annoying.",
      "Even though filming is prohibited in the venue, they just kept filming.",
      "I was about to tell the staff but didn't.",
      "Also, when leaving after the performance, it was crowded because there were too many people.",
      "Even after waiting over an hour, it was hard to get out.",
      "Public transportation was also too crowded, so it took long to get home.",
      "But I was satisfied because the performance itself was good.",
      "I thought next time I should book a better seat."
