      "작년 여름에 친구들이랑 강릉 바다 간 게 정말 기억에 남아.",
      "아침 일찍 출발해서 해돋이 보러 갔어.",
      "새벽 바다가 정말 조용하고 평화로웠어.",
      "해가 떠오르는 걸 보면서 다 같이 감탄했어.",
      "그 후에 근처 카페에서 아침 먹고 다시 바다로 갔어.",
      "수영복 입고 바다에 들어갔는데, 물이 생각보다 차가웠어.",
      "처음엔 춥다고 난리였는데, 익숙해지니까 괜찮았어.",
      "파도타기도 하고 수영도 하면서 놀았어.",
      "점심에는 바닷가 횟집에서 회 먹었는데 진짜 신선하고 맛있었어.",
      "오후에는 비치발리볼하다가 모래사장에 묻히기도 했어.",
      "저녁에 치킨이랑 맥주 먹으면서 노을 봤는데 정말 완벽했어.",
      "피곤했지만 정말 행복한 하루였어."

      "Last summer, going to Gangneung beach with friends is, like, really memorable.",
      "We left early in the morning to see the sunrise.",
      "The dawn ocean was really quiet and peaceful.",
      "We all admired it while watching the sun rise.",
      "After that, we ate breakfast at a nearby café and went back to the beach.",
      "We put on swimsuits and entered the ocean, but the water was colder than I thought.",
      "At first, everyone was making a fuss about it being cold, but once we got used to it, it was okay.",
      "We played riding the waves and swimming.",
      "For lunch, we ate sashimi at a beachside restaurant, and it was really fresh and delicious.",
      "In the afternoon, we played beach volleyball and also got buried in the sand.",
      "In the evening, we watched the sunset while eating chicken and beer, and it was, you know, really perfect.",
      "I was tired but it was a really happy day."
