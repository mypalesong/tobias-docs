      "작년 여름에 친구들이랑 바다 가기로 했었는데, 갑자기 태풍이 온다는 소식이 있었어.",
      "일주일 전부터 날씨 예보 계속 확인했는데, 점점 안 좋아지더라고.",
      "숙소도 이미 예약하고 교통편도 다 준비했는데 진짜 속상했어.",
      "출발 전날까지 고민하다가 결국 취소하기로 했어.",
      "숙소 취소하는 데 수수료도 좀 나갔고.",
      "대신 서울에 있는 실내 놀이공원 가기로 계획을 바꿨어.",
      "실내라서 날씨 걱정은 없었는데, 그래도 바다 못 간 게 아쉬웠어.",
      "근데 나중에 뉴스 보니까 그날 정말 비바람이 엄청 심했더라고.",
      "안 갔길 잘했다 싶었어.",
      "다음에 다시 계획 잡기로 했는데, 이번엔 날씨 좋을 때 가려고.",
      "그 이후로는 여행 계획 잡을 때 항상 날씨를 먼저 확인해.",
      "날씨가 정말 중요하다는 걸 그때 느꼈어."

      "Last summer, I was supposed to go to the beach with friends, but suddenly there was news that a typhoon was coming.",
      "I kept checking the weather forecast from a week before, and it, like, kept getting worse.",
      "We had already booked accommodation and prepared all the transportation, so I was really upset.",
      "We worried until the day before departure and, you know, finally decided to cancel.",
      "There was also a cancellation fee for the accommodation.",
      "Instead, we changed our plan to go to an indoor amusement park in Seoul.",
      "Since it was indoors, we didn't worry about the weather, but still, it was regretful we couldn't go to the beach.",
      "But later when I watched the news, the rain and wind were, like, really severe that day.",
      "I thought it was good we didn't go.",
      "We decided to plan again next time, and this time we'll go when the weather is good.",
      "Since then, when planning trips, I always check the weather first.",
      "I felt then that weather is really important."
