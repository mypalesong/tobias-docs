      "그때가 성인이 되는 첫 생일이었잖아요.",
      "친구들이 깜짝 파티를 준비해줬거든요.",
      "저녁에 PC방 간다고 해서 따라갔는데요,",
      "실제로는 친구 집에서 파티를 준비해놓은 거예요.",
      "문 열고 들어가니까 친구들이 다 모여있고, 케이크랑 음식도 있고 그랬어요.",
      "정말 감동받아서 눈물이 날 뻔했어요.",
      "그날 밤새도록 놀고 떠들고 정말 재밌었거든요.",
      "친구들이 돈 모아서 선물도 준비해줬는데, 제가 갖고 싶어 하던 시계였어요.",
      "그 시계를 지금도 가끔 차고 다녀요.",
      "그때 찍은 사진들도 아직 간직하고 있고요.",
      "그 생일 이후로 그렇게 특별한 생일은 없었던 것 같아요."
