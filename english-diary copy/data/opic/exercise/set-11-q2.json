      "작년 여름에 요가 시작했는데, 진짜 힘들었어.",
      "친구가 같이 하자고 해서 가벼운 마음으로 따라갔거든.",
      "첫 수업 듣는데 동작 하나하나가 다 어려웠어.",
      "몸이 너무 뻣뻣해서 다른 사람들처럼 못 따라가.",
      "특히 밸런스 잡는 동작에서 자꾸 넘어져서 창피했어.",
      "선생님이 괜찮다고 천천히 하라고 격려해 줬어.",
      "수업 끝나고 온몸이 땀으로 흠뻑 젖었어.",
      "다음 날 근육통이 장난 아니었어, 계단 오르기도 힘들었어.",
      "그만둘까 고민했는데, 친구가 계속 같이 가자고 해서 버텼어.",
      "한 달쯤 지나니까 몸이 좀 유연해지는 게 느껴졌어.",
      "지금은 주 1회는 꼭 요가 수업 들어.",
      "새로운 운동 도전한 게 정말 잘한 일인 것 같아."

      "Last summer, I started yoga, and it was, like, really hard.",
      "A friend asked me to do it together, so I followed along with a light heart.",
      "During the first class, every single movement was difficult.",
      "My body was so stiff that I couldn't keep up, you know, like other people.",
      "Especially during balance poses, I kept falling, so I was embarrassed.",
      "The teacher encouraged me saying it's okay and to do it slowly.",
      "After the class, my whole body was soaked with sweat.",
      "The next day, the muscle pain was no joke, it was hard to even climb stairs.",
      "I considered quitting, but my friend kept asking to go together, so I, well, endured.",
      "After about a month, I felt my body getting a bit more flexible.",
      "Now I definitely take yoga classes once a week.",
      "I think challenging a new exercise was really, I mean, a good thing to do."
