      "주말에 심심해서 쿠키 만들어봤는데, 생각보다 재밌더라.",
      "레시피는 핀터레스트에서 찾았는데, 간단해 보이는 걸로 골랐어.",
      "재료는 집에 있는 것도 있고, 없는 건 마트에서 사왔어.",
      "버터를 실온에 두는 게 중요하다는데, 깜빡해서 전자레인지 돌렸어.",
      "설탕이랑 버터 섞는 게 팔운동 되더라고, 진짜 힘들어.",
      "계란 넣고 밀가루 넣고, 섞다 보니 반죽이 완성됐어.",
      "초코칩 넣는데, 먹고 싶어서 조금 먹어버렸어, 솔직히.",
      "반죽을 동그랗게 만드는데, 크기가 다 들쑥날쑥해.",
      "오븐 예열하는 동안 설레더라고, 진짜 잘 구워질까?",
      "15분 타이머 맞춰놨는데, 중간에 확인하고 싶어서 문 열었어.",
      "쿠키가 부풀어 오르는 거 보니까 신기해.",
      "다 구워지고 나니 집 안에 쿠키 냄새가 가득해.",
      "식힌다고 참았는데, 뜨거울 때 하나 먹어봤어.",
      "겉은 바삭하고 속은 촉촉한 게, 진짜 맛있어.",
      "친구들 줄 거라고 포장했는데, 자꾸 먹게 돼서 남은 게 별로 없어."

      "I was bored over the weekend so I tried making cookies, and it was more fun than I thought.",
      "I found the recipe on Pinterest, and picked one that looked simple.",
      "Some ingredients I had at home, and what I didn't have I bought at the mart.",
      "Room temperature butter is important, but I forgot so I microwaved it.",
      "Mixing sugar and butter is like an arm workout, it's really hard.",
      "I added eggs and flour, and after mixing the dough was done.",
      "When adding chocolate chips, I wanted to eat some so I ate a little, honestly.",
      "I shaped the dough into balls, but the sizes are all uneven.",
      "While the oven was preheating I was excited, like will they bake well?",
      "I set a timer for 15 minutes, but I wanted to check in the middle so I opened the door.",
      "Watching the cookies puff up was fascinating.",
      "After they were done baking, the whole house smelled like cookies.",
      "I tried to wait for them to cool, but I ate one while it was hot.",
      "Crispy on the outside and soft inside, it's really delicious.",
      "I packaged them to give to friends, but I keep eating them so there's not much left."
