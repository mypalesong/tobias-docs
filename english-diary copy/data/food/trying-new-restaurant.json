      "어제 친구랑 새로 생긴 레스토랑 가봤는데, 분위기 진짜 좋더라.",
      "SNS에서 핫하다길래 궁금해서 예약했거든.",
      "입구부터 인테리어가 세련돼서 기대가 됐어.",
      "메뉴판 보는데 뭘 시켜야 할지 진짜 고민됐어, 다 맛있어 보여서.",
      "웨이터한테 추천 메뉴 물어봤는데, 진짜 친절하게 설명해줬어.",
      "결국 시그니처 메뉴 두 개 시켰는데, 가격이 좀 나가더라고.",
      "근데 음식 나오는 플레이팅 보고 놀랐어, 완전 예술 작품 같았어.",
      "맛은 기대 이상이었는데, 양이 좀 적은 게 아쉬웠어.",
      "고급 레스토랑이 다 그런가 봐, 맛으로 승부하는 거지.",
      "디저트도 주문했는데, 이것도 비주얼이 미쳤어.",
      "친구랑 사진 엄청 찍었는데, SNS 올리니까 반응이 좋더라.",
      "계산할 때 좀 당황했는데, 예상보다 많이 나왔거든.",
      "그래도 경험으로는 나쁘지 않았어, 특별한 날 가기 좋을 것 같아.",
      "다음엔 다른 메뉴도 먹어보고 싶은데, 지갑 사정을 봐야 할 듯.",
      "가끔 이렇게 좋은 곳에서 밥 먹는 것도 힐링이야."

      "I went to this new restaurant with a friend yesterday, and the vibe was really nice.",
      "I was curious because it was trending on social media, so I made a reservation.",
      "From the entrance, the interior was so stylish I got excited.",
      "Looking at the menu, I really couldn't decide what to order because everything looked good.",
      "I asked the waiter for recommendations, and they explained everything so nicely.",
      "We ended up ordering two signature dishes, but the price was kind of steep.",
      "But when I saw the plating, I was shocked, it looked like a work of art.",
      "The taste was better than expected, but the portion was a bit small unfortunately.",
      "I guess that's how fancy restaurants are, they compete on taste.",
      "We also ordered dessert, and the presentation was insane.",
      "My friend and I took so many pictures, and when I posted them on social media the reaction was good.",
      "I was a bit flustered when paying because it was more than expected.",
      "Still, as an experience it wasn't bad, seems like a good place for special occasions.",
      "Next time I want to try other menu items, but I'll have to see how my wallet's doing.",
      "Sometimes eating at a nice place like this is healing, you know?"
